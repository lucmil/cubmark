/** \brief Adaptive algorithm for non-adaptive cubature algorithms
 *
 * This is an \a adapter for existing Method classes.
 * The "worker" class is invoked on the region of integration.
 * If the worker method fails, the region is divided along both axes
 * and the worker object is invoked on each of the four subdivisions.
 *
 * Infinite limits are supported as long as the worker class supports them.
 *
 * \todo Check if the class could find a better result by searching the tree
 *       more thoroughly.
 *
 * \todo If all subdivisions return a successful result, but the sum of their
 *       error estimates E exceeds the required tolerance, then the subdivision
 *       with the largest error estimate should be subdivided further.
 *
 *       Let \f$ E = \sum E_i \f$ denote the error estimate of the final result,
 *       where E_i is the error of the result of the i-th subdivision.
