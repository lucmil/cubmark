/** \file
 * \brief Main header for functor Adapters
 *
 * This library provides a method for interfacing C code with C++ code.
 *
 * \par Quick start:
 * Skip the rationale and
 * see cb::UnaryAdapter and cb::BinaryAdapter documentation in the
 * adapter/types.h header for example usage.
 *
 * \par Rationale:
 * A common usage pattern for interfacing with legacy C code is to define a
 * functor, use a function as an entry point for the C code, like
 * so:
 * \code
 * struct power
 * {
 *    f() : k(0) {}
 *    f(int k) : k(k) {}
 *    int k;
 *    int operator()(int x) const
 *    {
 *      return / * x^k * /;
 *    }
 * };
 *
 * power functor;
 * int Adapter(int x)
 * {
 *     return functor(x);
 * }
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *     functor = power(10);
 *     std::cout << legacy_c_function(&Adapter) << '\n';
 * }
 * \endcode
 * But this becomes tedious as every functor requires it's own hand-written
 * function. This approach also limits the number of simultaneous
 * instances of the functor to one (or one's mastery of the copy-paste buffer).
 *
 * This library provides a straightforward method of functor->function pointer
 * "conversion" via an Adapter. The number of simultaneous instances of a
 * functor is limited at compile-time, with the upper limit being specific to
 * the compiler's template depth recursion.
 *
 * See cb::AdapterTraits.
 *
 * \todo Rewrite the library to enable in-lining of functors.
 * \todo Better documentation of the concepts a functor must fullfil to
 *       be usable with Adapters.
