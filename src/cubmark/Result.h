	 *
	 * Produce a terse string which classifies a result in several categories.
	 * Each character of the string represents a classification in a single category
	 *
	 * 1. <tt>{S|F}</tt> - Success / Failure (Positive / Negative result).
	 *
	 *    Determines how the method flagged the result.
	 *
	 * 2. <tt>{+|-|m|M}</tt> - Properly flagged / False negative / Minor failure /
	 *                         Major failure
	 *
	 *    Determines if the error was:
	 *    - within the requested tolerance or properly flagged as a failure
	 *    - within the requested tolerance but has been flagged as a failure
	 *    - within an order of magnitude of the requested tolerance,
	 *      but has been flagged as successful.
	 *    - beyond an order of magnitude of the requested tolerance,
	 *      but has been flagged as successful.
	 *
	 * 3. <tt>{e|E}</tt> - Real error smaller / greater than the method's estimate.
	 *
	 * Examples (this isn't a comprehensive list):
	 * - "S+e" - Successful result with a good error estimate.
	 * - "S+E" - Successful result. Error estimate failure.
	 * - "F+e" - Negative result. The method failed to achieve the
	 *           requested tolerance and reported a failure. The returned
	 *           Result.had a good error estimate.
	 * - "SmE" - Minor evaluation failure. The method failed but reported a
	 *           successful evaluation. The error estimate was off by less than
	 *           an order of magnitude.
	 * - "SJE" - Major failure. The method failed but reported a successful
	 *           evaluation. The error estimate was off by at least
	 *           an order of magnitude.
	 * - "S-e" - False negative result. The method failed to recognize a
	 *           successfully evaluated cubature. Error estimate within tolerance
	 *           suggests a bug in error reporting code.
	 *
	 * \param r A benchmark result.
	 * \return Classification string.
